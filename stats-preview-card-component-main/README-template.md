### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

using of display flex property and positioning of elements using relative and absolute.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

```

```css
.main {
  margin: 50px auto;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  position: relative;
  width: 400px;
  height: 900px;
}
```
